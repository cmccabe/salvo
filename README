Salvo is a turn-based artillery game in which tanks do battle with wacky
weapons.  Choose from three different AI opponents, ranging from the simple
Random computer, to the devious Hard opponent. You can also play against
multiple human opponents.

Salvo was written for Android 1.0, although it should work on later versions as
well.
