        Salvo is a turn-based artillery game in which tanks do battle with
        wacky weapons.<p>

        Choose from three different AI opponents, ranging from the simple
        Random computer, to the devious Hard opponent. You can also play 
        against multiple human opponents.<p>

        <a name="rounds"></a><h2>Rounds</h2>
        Each round of the game starts with the buy weapons screen. Here, you 
        buy all the weapons that you want for later. The weapon names displayed
        in red are too expensive for you to buy. The buy weapons screen
        will not be displayed if you don't have enough money to buy anything!<p>

        When the round starts, you will have full health. Try to destroy the 
        other tanks before they can get you! The more enemies you frag, the
        more money you will get to buy weapons in the next round.<p>

        When there are no more rounds left, the player who earned the most cash
        is the winner.<p>
        
        <a name="how_to_fire_a_missile"></a><h2>How to Fire a Missile</h2>
        To shoot a missile, start by choosing the angle.<p>

        Touch a spot on the playing field and your turret will point directly
        at that spot. The lower right-hand corner of the screen displays the
        current angle. You can see that in this example, the tank's turret is
        at a 45 degree angle.<p>

        <img src="file:///android_asset/tanks.jpg"><p>

        Next, hold down the fire button. The longer you hold down the fire
        button, the more power your shot will have! If you hold down the power
        button for as long as you can, your shot will be fired with maximum
        power. You can see that the fire button is in the lower right-hand
        corner of the screen.<p>

        To choose a different weapon, press the grey left or right triangle
        buttons in the center of the screen. Currently we have selected "Small
        Missile." There are also Medium Missiles available at the start of the
        game. You can buy more weapons after the round is over.<p>
        
        <a name="weapon_types"></a><h2>Weapon Types</h2>
        You have an unlimited supply of <b>Small Missiles</b>. They don't
        usually do much damage, but a direct hit by one can be devastating!<p>

        <b>Medium Missiles</b> are a like the small missile's bigger cousin.
        The biggest conventional missile is the <b>Large Missile</b>.<p>

        <b>Earthmovers</b> don't do any direct
        damage to enemies. Instead, they clear away dirt out from under them!
        Enemies will suffer fall damage when they fall down, but usually
        survive.<p>

        If you are running out of life, try some <b>Extra Armor</b>. It will
        recharge your shields and give you a new lease on life!<p>

        If you are in a jam, try using a <b>Teleporter</b> to move your tank
        to a different place on the map!<p>

        <b>Rollers</b> and <b>Large Rollers</b> don't explode on impact.
        Instead, they roll down the hill until encountering an uphill piece of
        terrain or an enemy tank.<p>

        When <b>Cluster Bombs</b> explode, they hurl small warheads over a
        wide area. Each warhead is not that powerful, but there are several.<p>

        Launching the <b>Doomhammer</b> might seem like a good idea, but think
        twice...<p>

        <a name="game_options"></a><h2>Game Options</h2>
        <b>Number of rounds</b> selects how many rounds will be in the game.
        Players get to buy weapons after each round.<p>

        <b>Starting Cash</b> selects how much cash everyone gets before the
        first round.<p>

        If <b>Randomize Player Positions</b> is checked, the players will be
        randomly placed on the board. If not, the players will be placed on
        the board from left to right, with the first player on the leftmost
        edge.<p>

        <a name="player_options"></a><h2>Player Options</h2>
        Each player has a different color. You can add or delete players by 
        pressing the "add" or "delete" buttons on the Player Setup screen.<p>

        <b>Human players</b> are you and me. You can have as many human 
        players as you like in a game. They will take turns.<p>
        
        <b>Random computers</b> fire randomly. They usually only hit empty 
        space, or themselves, but sometimes they hit something.<p>

        <b>Medium computers</b> are more sophisticated. Once they start 
        firing at you, watch out! They will refine their shot over time,
        getting closer and closer to the target.<p>
        
        <b>Hard computers</b> are even more devious than medium computers.
        Usually hard computers are able to get a good shot quicker than medium 
        ones.<p>
        
        You can start with anywhere between <b>25%</b> and <b>300%</b> life.
        Obviously, the less life you start with, the more difficult your game
        will be!<p>
