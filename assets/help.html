        <h2>About</h2>
        Salvo is a turn-based artillery game in which tanks do battle with
        wacky weapons.<p>

        Choose from three different AI opponents, ranging from the simple
        Random computer, to the devious Hard opponent.<p>

        <h2>Rounds</h2>
        A game has 

        The more enemies you frag, the more money you get to buy weapons.

        <h2>Weapons</h2>
        You have an unlimited supply of <b>Small Missiles</b>. They don't
        usually do much damage, but a direct hit by one can be devastating!<p>

        <b>Medium Missiles</b> are a like the small missile's bigger cousin.
        The biggest conventional missile is the <b>Large Missile</b>.<p>

        <b>Earthmovers</b> and <b>Large Earthmovers</b> don't do any direct
        damage to enemies. Instead, they clear away dirt out from under them!
        Enemies will suffer fall damage when they fall down, but usually
        survive.<p>

        If you are running out of life, try some <b>Extra Armor</b>. It will
        recharge your shields and give you a new lease on life!<p>

        If you are in a jam, try using a <b>Teleporter</b> to move your tank
        to a different place on the map!<p>

        <b>Rollers</b> and <b>Large Rollers</b> don't explode on impact.
        Instead, they roll down the hill until encountering an uphill piece of
        terrain or an enemy tank.<p>

        When <b>Cluster Bombs</b> explode, they hurl small warheads over a
        wide area. Each warhead is not that powerful, but there are several.

        Launching the <b>Doomhammer</b> might seem like a good idea, but think
        twice...<p>

        <h2>Game Options</h2>
        <b>Number of rounds</b> selects how many rounds will be in the game.
        Players get to buy weapons after each round.

        <b>Starting Cash</b> selects how much cash everyone gets before the
        first round.

        If <b>Randomize Player Positions</b> is checked, the players will be
        randomly placed on the board. If not, the players will be placed on
        the board from left to right, with the first player on the leftmost
        edge.
